# Regression
This repository hosts a Linear regression analysis project focused on predicting salaries based on years of experience. The project leverages a comprehensive dataset containing information on individuals' years of experience in a particular field and their corresponding salaries. 
The main objective of this project is to develop and evaluate Linear regression models that accurately estimate salaries based on the number of years an individual has worked in a specific industry or role. Through thorough data exploration, model training, and evaluation, the project aims to uncover meaningful insights into the relationship between years of experience and salary levels.
